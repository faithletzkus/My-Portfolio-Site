          <h2><strong>About This Project</strong></h2>
          <p>This project is a blog site I created with a partner for my Rapid and Creative Prototype Development course. 
            We build it in on an ec2 instance through AWS using PHP and mySQL for the database.</p>
          <p>Through this project, I also learned more about computer security measures for web applications 
            such as the importance of hashing passwords, and preventing against SQL injection attacks and CSRF attacks. 
            We also incorporated these security measures into our site.</p>

          <h2><strong>Functionalities</strong></h2>
          <p>With the site, you can create an account or log in, write blog posts, comment on posts, 
            edit your past stories or comments, see how many times a story was viewed, and look up stories by categories. 
            You can passively view the site by selecting “View as guest” on the login screen.</p>

          <h2><strong>Video Demo</strong></h2>
          <p>Since this was a class project,
            I am unable to show any code. However, here is a video demo
            of my app and how it works.
