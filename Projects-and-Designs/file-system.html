          <h2><strong>About the Project</strong></h2>
          <p>For the final project of my Object Oriented Programming course, my partner and I
            were challenged to create a software simulation of a file system. Our program
            allowed you to choose between a simple file system and a hierarchical file system.</p>
          <p>With the simple file system, you could create files, write to or append to files,
          list all files, display contents of files, and remove files. With the hierarchical
          file system, you could also create directories, giving you all of the previous
          functionality plus more, including the ability to cd in and out of directories,
          copy files to new locations, and create symbolic links of files. </p>
          <p>I found the project very intriguing because I had the opportunity to put the OOP ideas I had
          been learning about into practice and see how they really do benefit abstraction
          and create really cool solutions.Â </p>
          <p>*Note: Due to the fact that this was a school project, I am unable to share the code.</p>

          <h2><strong>Takeaways</strong></h2>
          <p>We encountered many problems dealing with abstraction in this project. Through
          the process of solving these problems, I learned so much. That is what I really loved
          about this project; I could actually see my skills improving, and I now have a great
          understanding of OOP design.</p>
