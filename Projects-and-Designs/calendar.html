          <h2><strong>About This Project</strong></h2>
          <p>This project is a Calendar Web App I created with a partner for my Rapid and Creative Prototype Development course. 
            We build it in on an ec2 instance through AWS using JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, AJAX, and mySQL for the database. </p>
          <p>Through this project, I also learned more about computer security measures for web applications such as the 
            importance of hashing passwords, session cookies, and preventing against SQL injection attacks and CSRF attacks. 
            We also incorporated these security measures into our site.</p>

          <h2><strong>Functionalities</strong></h2>
          <p>With this web app, you can create an account or log in, and have immediate access to your own calendar! 
            From here, create new events, categorize them, give them a date and time, and add notes to the event. 
            Don’t worry; If you need to go back and edit anything later – you can. Prefer using 24 hour time over AM/PM 
            – you can switch between the two with the click of a button! The page automatically loads on the current month, 
            but you can look in the past of in the future as far as you’d like. Finally, we have a share feature! Add 
            and remove friend’s usernames from the share dropdown to share (or stop sharing) your calendar with others. 
            At the bottom of the page, you can see calendars from friends that have listed your name in there share drop down. 
            By clicking on their name, you can access their calendar by view only – no editing allowed! To get back to your 
            calendar, just click the “My Calendar” button in the top left.</p>

          <h2><strong>Video Demo</strong></h2>
          <p>Since this was a class project,
            I am unable to show any code. However, here is a video demo
            of my app and how it works.
