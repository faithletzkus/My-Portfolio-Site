          <h2><strong>About This Project</strong></h2>
          <p>This is a group project for Mobile App Development that serves as our final project. My group is creating an app that acts as a teaching supplement game to learning graph searches in a Data Structures and Algorithms class. The app helps students practice the algorithms that they have learned about but want more practice with.</p>
          <p>The app auto-generates a graph of easy, medium or hard difficulty, with directed or undirected edges (these settings can be changed). The algorithms implemented currently are breadth-first search and depth-first search. The user's job is to click the next correct vertex in the sequence until all of the vertices have been reached. We also built a timer mode that challenges the user to solve as many graphs as possible in 30 seconds. A personal-bests scoreboard shows your progress.</p>

          <h2><strong>In the Future</strong></h2>
          <p>Although this App was a school project, my group and I would like to continue the project and get it puplished to the app store for students.
          The app currently works on all devices and we hope implement a build your own graph feature as an update to the app.</p>

          <h2><strong>Video Demo</strong></h2>
          <p>Due to the fact that this was a class project,
            I am unable to show any code. However, here is a video demo
            of the current app and how it works.

          <h2><strong>Wireframe</strong></h2>
          <p>Before cerating the app, I wireframed it using PowerPoint.
            These were the first drafts and some designs did change as we built the app.</p>
          <p>Check out the video above to see the latest version of the app.</p>
