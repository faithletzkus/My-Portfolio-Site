          <h2><strong>About the Project</strong></h2>
          <p>This was as assignment for my Object-Oriented-Programming course that
            allowed the user to play a game of TicTacToe or Gomoku. My partner and
            I also completed the extra credit portion which was to allow the game
            of Gomoku to be customized. Customization meant that the user could specify
            the width and height of the board, as well as the number of pieces in a
            row needed to win the game. The assignment called for customized board
            sizes that were squares, but my partner and I wanted rectangles to be a
            possibility for our game boards as well. </p>

          <h2><strong>A Problem We Encountered</strong></h2>
            <p>The main challenge of this program was the draw functionality.
              A “draw” meant the game was supposed to end when there were no more
              moves that could lead to a win (not simply when the board was full).
              Since, this was a school project, I am unable to speak to how we
              solved it, however we did solve it!</p>

          <h2><strong>Takeaways</strong></h2>
          <p>I found the project fun and useful because I had the opportunity
            to really hone in my C++ skills and put some OOP designs into practice.
            And of course, I was able to improve my TicTacToe and Gomoku skills ;).</p>

*Note: Due to the fact that this was a school project, I am unable to share the code.</p>
